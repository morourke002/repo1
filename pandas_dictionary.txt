Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Dictionary.

1) Exploratory data analysis

Univariate visualization of and summary statistics for each field in the raw dataset
Bivariate visualization and summary statistics for assessing the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest (e.g. time until churn, spend)
Multivariate visualizations to understand interactions between different fields in the data
Dimensionality reduction to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data
Clustering of similar observations in the dataset into differentiated groupings, which by collapsing the data into a few small data points, patterns of behavior can be more easily identified

2) Dealing with missing values

# Drop the columns where all elements are missing values:
df.dropna(axis=1, how='all')

# Drop the columns where any of the elements are missing values
df.dropna(axis=1, how='any')

# Keep only the rows which contain 2 missing values maximum
df.dropna(thresh=2)

# Drop the columns where any of the elements are missing values
df.dropna(axis=1, how='any')

# Fill all missing values with the mean of the particular column
df.fillna(df.mean())

# Fill any missing value in column 'A' with the column median
df['A'].fillna(df['A'].median())

# Fill any missing value in column 'Depeche' with the column mode
df['Depeche'].fillna(df['Depeche'].mode())

3) Dealing with outliers
4) Dealing with imbalance data
5) Data Transformations
	-- normalization
	-- min-max standardization
